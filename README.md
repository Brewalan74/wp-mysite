# wp-mysite
WordPress version of my website (portfolio)

How to install this site in local : in the terminal follow the instruction next below.

First clone the project :
```bash
git clone ssh_key
```

Install WordPress :
```bash
cd _bin
sh install.sh
```

during the installation you will have to check and/or answer some question :
```bash
installation folder (by default) : push enter
site URL (by default) : push enter
Mysql user (by default) : Database username
Mysql password (by default) : Database password
Mysql host (localhost) : push enter or change your host
Mysql database (by default) : give a name to your database
Mysql table prefix (by default) : give a prefix to the database tables, usually its wp_, but you better change that
Site name (by default) : Give a name to the website
Admin login (by default) : WordPress admin username
Admin password (by default) : Wordpress admin password
Admin email (by default) : your email
Continue ? [y]/n : check and choose y for yes or n for no
```
After that, I guess you can manage to get to WordPress dashboard... 

If you decide to code directly here, please do it into a new branch who start from develop, and ask me to check before to merge anything... 

tx and have fun
